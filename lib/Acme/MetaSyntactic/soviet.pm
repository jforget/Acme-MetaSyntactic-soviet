=head1 NAME

Acme::MetaSyntactic::soviet -- NATO codenames for Soviet-designed equipment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some codenames  given by  NATO to Soviet-designed  aircraft, missiles,
submarines,   radars  and  other   electronic  systems.   The  various
categories and sub-categories are

=over 4

=item *

electronic

=item *

electronic/radars

=item *

electronic/misc

=item *

vehicles

=item *

vehicles/aircraft

=item *

vehicles/helicopters

=item *

vehicles/missiles

=item *

vehicles/submarines

=item *

vehicles/error

=back

The default category is 'electronic'.

=head1 VERSION

This  is version  0.04, the  "???"  version, released  on the  ??th
anniversary of ???

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::MetaSyntactic;

    my $meta = Acme::MetaSyntactic->new( 'soviet' );
    
    print $meta->name();          # return a single name
    my @names = $meta->name( 4 ); # return 4 distinct names (if possible)

If you want some category other than 'electronic', the second line should
read:

    my $meta = Acme::MetaSyntactic->new( 'soviet', category => 'vehicle/aircraft' );

If C<meta>  from L<Acme::MetaSyntactic> is  installed, you can  use it
from the command line:

    meta soviet

    meta soviet/vehicles/submarines

=head1 SOURCES

Note: I  have used  only sources published  I<before> the fall  of the
Soviet Union. Therefore, the  module name is C<A::MS::soviet>, with no
"ex-"  prefix.  For  each entry,  the  sources are  listed, with  page
numbers for the books. The games use data cards, which are unnumbered.

Some sources, especially early  sources, may contain some errors. Some
equipment  may appear with  faulty intelligence  reports which  give a
wrong  code or  description.  And  a later  intelligence  report would
correct it.  The best  example is the  Backfire, first given  the code
"Tu-26" and then the code "Tu-22M".

=head2 Main Sources

These sources  contain extensive lists  or extensive tables  of soviet
equipment.

__DATA__

=head2 ELECTRONIC

The codenames for electronic devices are composed of two words. As you
can notice, similar  devices share one word and  differ with the other
word, e.g. Scan Fix and Scan Odd.  You may find in other sources these
codenames aggregated as a single word, e.g. Barlock.
